**PLAY FAIR ONLINE**

Naturally S&amp;BCC does not condone cheating. The 4NCL online – where we several have teams – requires players to sign up to fair play guidelines designed to reduce it. The 4NCL has detection arrangements and banning protocols in addition to those used by the Lichess platform itself. A sample 4NCL fairplay report is available here: [https://www.4ncl.co.uk/data/history/news-1.htm#fpreport2](https://www.4ncl.co.uk/data/history/news-1.htm#fpreport2) . You will see that there have been a number of bans, with a few more players under surveillance.

There is some further advice that we would like to offer our players when online - whether playing for the club, or on their own account. You need to be aware that Lichess takes a dim view of letting your clock run down instead of resigning (and so does the club). Disconnecting instead of resigning is also bad form. Repeat offenders may get warned by the platforms, and/or their account closed.
