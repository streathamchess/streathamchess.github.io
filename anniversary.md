Come along to the Streatham Society to hear Martin reveal something of the club’s back story, timed to coincide with the publication of Movers and Takers – a 150 year saga of chess in Streatham and Brixton

#### Simul by GM Daniel King

Daniel King (a past member of S&BCC) v members of the club – 12.30pm to 4.30pm Saturday 13 November at the Streatham Tate Library.

We are looking for 20 club members to take on GM Daniel King (well-known commentator and coach) in a simul on the 13 November. Upcoming improvers and juniors will be especially welcome, as will be a handful of our stronger players.

Let’s show Daniel that S&BCC is still a force to be reckoned with 40-odd years after he was a member. There will be a voluntary £10 board fee. Let Paul Ritchie know if you’d like to play.
