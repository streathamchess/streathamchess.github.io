Welcome – you’ve arrived at Streatham & Brixton Chess Club’s website. We hope you’ll take a few moments to find out more about us – we’re a lively chess club with a fast-growing membership and we provide opportunities for chess players of all abilities.

We’re keen to attract experienced players who are looking for serious competitive chess, casual players who want to play friendly social chess, and newcomers to the game who want to develop their chess skills.

We offer one of the best-value membership packages in London with a special reduced rate for the first year of membership. If all you want is to play ungraded games of friendly chess, you won't have to pay anything at all.
