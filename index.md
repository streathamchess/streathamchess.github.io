## Chess during coronavirus outbreak

At the moment there is no face to face chess because of the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. All leagues are still suspended and our venue for social chess, the community centre at Streatham Library, is not currently available.

However Streatham Chess Club is extremely active online:

- We field teams in national and local leagues
- We hold regular internal tournaments, both informal fun ones and more serious competitions
- Members run online simuls and other events
- We also plan on having some social events, such as quizzes and talks on Zoom

Because all events are online everyone is welcome to take part, and there are no club membership fees being charged.

### Getting started with online chess

To get started playing with clubmates and in club-organised events, do the following:

#### 1) Create an account on lichess.org

Register with lichess  [(https://lichess.org/)](https://lichess.org/), and create an online user name (if possible one that other members will be able to easily recognize). You can start playing casual games straightaway. 

#### 2) Join our online club

Join our lichess online club by visiting [https://lichess.org/team/streatham--brixton-chess-club](https://lichess.org/team/streatham--brixton-chess-club) and hit ‘Join’. Note that it might take a day or so for your membership request to be processed by club officers.

Joining the online group will help you find fellow members and enable you to play in club-only events.

Keep an eye on the club's lichess forum: [https://lichess.org/forum/team-streatham--brixton-chess-club](https://lichess.org/forum/team-streatham--brixton-chess-club)

Here we will post messages about what will be happening online for our members.

#### 3) Mobile apps

Once you are all set up on lichess you might want to get a mobile app. These are available in the normal Apple and Google app stores. Some information about the mobile apps can be found here:  [https://lichess.org/mobile](https://lichess.org/mobile)

Be aware that not all lichess features can be accessed via the apps, so you may prefer to play using the lichess website, even when using a phone or tablet.
