Welcome – you’ve arrived at Streatham & Brixton Chess Club’s website.
We hope you’ll take a few moments to find out more about us – we’re a lively chess club
with a fast-growing membership and we provide opportunities for chess players of all
abilities.

We’re keen to attract new players off all kinds: experienced players who are looking for serious competitive chess,
casual players who want to play friendly social chess, and newcomers to the game who want
to develop their chess skills.

We offer one of the best-value membership packages in London with a special reduced rate
for the first year of membership. If all you want is to play ungraded games of friendly
chess, you won't have to pay anything at all.

So read on to learn a little [about us](/about/index.html), [where we play](/about/venues.html) and [how to join](/join.html). When you're ready feel free to drop by at one our Tuesday sessions at the Library, or [get in touch](contact.html) to learn more.
