## Chess during coronavirus outbreak

There is no face to face chess during the coronavirus outbreak. All leagues are suspended and our venue for social chess, Streatham Library, is closed.

However Streatham Chess Club is working towards going online.

To play with clubmates and in club-organised events, do the following:

### 1) Create an account on lichess.org

Register with lichess  [(https://lichess.org/)](https://lichess.org/), and create an online user name (if possible one that other members will be able to easily recognize). You can start playing causal games straightaway. 

### 2) Join our online club

Join our lichess online club by visiting [https://lichess.org/team/streatham--brixton-chess-club](https://lichess.org/team/streatham--brixton-chess-club) and hit ‘Join’. Note that it might take a day or so for your membership request to be processed by club officers.

Joining the online group will help you find fellow members and enable you to play in club-only events.

Keep an eye on the club's lichess forum: [https://lichess.org/forum/team-streatham--brixton-chess-club](https://lichess.org/forum/team-streatham--brixton-chess-club)

Here we will post messages about what will be happening online for our members.

### 3) Mobile apps

Once you are all set up on lichess you might want to get a mobile app. These are available in the normal Apple and Google app stores. Some information about the mobile apps can be found here:  [https://lichess.org/mobile](https://lichess.org/mobile)

## Welcome

Welcome – you’ve arrived at Streatham & Brixton Chess Club’s website.
We hope you’ll take a few moments to find out more about us – we’re a lively chess club
with a fast-growing membership and we provide opportunities for chess players of all
abilities.

We’re keen to attract new players of all kinds: experienced players who are looking for serious competitive chess,
casual players who want to play friendly social chess, and newcomers to the game who want
to develop their chess skills.

We offer one of the best-value membership packages in London with a special reduced rate
for the first year of membership. If all you want is to play ungraded games of friendly
chess, you won't have to pay anything at all.

So read on to learn a little more [about us](/about/index.html), [where we play](/about/venues.html) and [how to join](/join.html). Feel free to simply drop by at one our Tuesday sessions at Streatham Library, or [get in touch](contact.html) for more information on the club.
