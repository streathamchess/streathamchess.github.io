## Chess during coronavirus outbreak

There is no face to face chess during the coronavirus crisis. All leagues are suspended, and our venue for social chess, Streatham Library, is closed.

However Streatham Chess Club is working on going online.

To play with clubmates and in club-organised events, do the following:

### 1) Create and account on lichess.org

Register with lichess  (https://lichess.org/), and create an online user name (if possible one that other memebers will be able to recognize). You can start playing causal games straightaway. 

### 2) Join our online club

Join our lichess online club using  https://lichess.org/team/streatham--brixton-chess-club and hit ‘Join’.

This will help you find fellow members and enable you to play in club-only events.

Keep and eye on the club's lichess forum: https://lichess.org/forum/team-streatham--brixton-chess-club

Here we will post messages about what will be happening online for our members.

### 3) Mobile apps

Once you are set up on lichess you might want to get a mobile app. These are available in the normal Apple and Google app stores. Some information about the mobile apps can be found here:  https://lichess.org/mobile

Welcome – you’ve arrived at Streatham & Brixton Chess Club’s website.
We hope you’ll take a few moments to find out more about us – we’re a lively chess club
with a fast-growing membership and we provide opportunities for chess players of all
abilities.

We’re keen to attract new players of all kinds: experienced players who are looking for serious competitive chess,
casual players who want to play friendly social chess, and newcomers to the game who want
to develop their chess skills.

We offer one of the best-value membership packages in London with a special reduced rate
for the first year of membership. If all you want is to play ungraded games of friendly
chess, you won't have to pay anything at all.

So read on to learn a little more [about us](/about/index.html), [where we play](/about/venues.html) and [how to join](/join.html). Feel free to simply drop by at one our Tuesday sessions at Streatham Library, or [get in touch](contact.html) for more information on the club.
