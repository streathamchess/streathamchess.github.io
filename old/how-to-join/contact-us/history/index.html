<p style='font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif'>Streatham &amp; Brixton Chess Club can claim to be one of London’s
oldest chess clubs with a history that goes back to Victorian times. </p>



<p style='font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif'>The club as we know it today was formed in 1946 when
Streatham Chess Club merged with Brixton Chess Club. We don’t know exactly when Brixton Chess Club
was founded - if anyone thinks they know, we’d be very interested to hear from
them! But we do know that it was in existence in 1884/85 because it won the
Surrey Trophy that year. The club seems to have been well established by then because it won the trophy again in each of the next two seasons. In 1887 it was one
of the founder members of the London Chess League. </p>



<p style='font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif'>Streatham Chess Club was founded in 1918 and met at the
White Lion Restaurant on Streatham High Road, which remained its venue for
several decades. After the merger, Streatham &amp; Brixton Chess Club continued
to meet there until the mid 1950s when it moved to Streatham Baths. Later
venues included the Bedford Park
and Sultan pubs in Streatham and, more recently, the Priory Arms in Stockwell.</p><p style='font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif'><b><div style='display:inline;margin:5px 10px;float:right'><a href='../../../how-to-join/contact-us/history/Leeming%20Hereford%20Chess%20Club.jpg?attredirects=0/index.html'><img width='400' src='https://sites.google.com/site/streathambrixtonchessclub/_/rsrc/1290772975902/how-to-join/contact-us/history/Leeming%20Hereford%20Chess%20Club.jpg' height='287' border='0'/></a></div></b></p>




<p style='font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif'>Both clubs had their ups and downs. Brixton Chess Club was
notably successful in the 1920s and early 1930s when it won the Surrey Trophy
in five consecutive seasons and the Eastman Cup in its first three seasons. In
1930/31 it was the second largest club in the country. Around this time Harry
Golombek, who went on to be British Chess Champion as well as writing many
books on chess, was a member of Brixton Chess Club. A generation later, another
future British Chess Champion was a member of our club – Ray Keene.</p>




<p style='font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif'><b>1970s resurgence</b></p>





<p style='font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif'>The club hit hard times in the late 1960s and early 1970s. But
a remarkable resurgence followed, prompted partly by the Fischer-Spassky world title
match of 1972, which generated a wave of enthusiasm for chess. An active junior programme attracted talented young players to the club, including Julian Hodgson and Daniel King who both went on to become grandmasters.</p>





<p style='font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif'>The club’s fortunes peaked during the 1970s, driven by the
energy and enthusiasm of Nigel Povah, Mike Singleton and others. In the 1976/77
the club won just about everything in sight, including the first divisions of
both the London Chess League and the Surrey League. During this period the club
produced three issues of the magazine <i>Knightmare!</i>
which we have scanned and are available as downloads (see below).Â </p>


<p style='font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif'>After a fall-off in membership during the late 1990s and early
2000s, membership has recovered strongly and the club now has more than 60 active
members.</p><p style='font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif'><b><i>Knightmare!</i> downloads</b><br/></p><p style='font-family:trebuchet ms,sans-serif'>PDF files of <i>Knightmare!</i> can be downloaded by clicking on the links below.
