### Chess in Central London

{% include image.html url="/assets/photos/central-london.jpg" description="London League match at Golden Lane Community Centre" %}

You don’t have to live in the Streatham area to play for us – many of our members live north of the river or outside 
London. They prefer to play their team chess in Central London because of the convenient location and the high quality 
that the [London Chess League](http://www.londonchess.org.uk/main.php) offers. In fact we play more league chess at 
Golden Lane than we do at Woodfield Grove.

We have four teams in the London Chess League – a 12-board team in Division 1, a 10-board team in Division 2, 
a 10-board team in Division 3, and a 4-board team in the Minor division. Most matches are played at the Golden 
Lane Community Centre, which is located here on the Barbican estate.

If you think you might like to play for us in the London Chess League, please contact one of our club officers.

###Chess at Woodfield Grove

We get together at Woodfield Grove Tennis Club in Streatham on most Tuesday evenings during the chess season 
(which runs from September through to May). 

Here we play home matches in the [Surrey League](http://www.scca.co.uk/) and the 
[Croydon & District League](http://www.croydonchessleague.org.uk/). We have an 8-board team in 
the top division of the Surrey League, four 4-board teams in the Croydon & District League, and we also play in 
Surrey League's knockout competitions. Our away matches are held at various venues in South London and Surrey.

We play internal club competitions at Woodfield Grove, and during the season we have occasional open evenings 
when chess players who are thinking of joining can meet us and play some informal games. If you are interested 
in coming along to our next open evening, please contact one of our club officers.

Woodfield Grove Tennis Club is located at 9 Woodfield Grove, London SW16 1LR. There's a map 
[here](https://goo.gl/maps/IH4ra), please note the club is on the south side of the road. 
The entrance is at the end of the terrace down a short path and access is via an entryphone. 
It is about 10 minutes walk from Streatham Hill mainline station and there are 
bus stops along Streatham High Road.

If you are arriving by car, it is best to park on Woodfield Avenue where there are plenty of spaces. 
Woodfield Grove itself is one-way and can only be approached by car from Woodfield Avenue.

You can play chess at the [White Lion bar](http://whitelion.org.uk/) on Tuesday evenings throughout the year from 5.00 pm till late. 
The White Lion is located [here](https://goo.gl/maps/rlRcp) at 232/234 Streatham High Road, SW16 1BB. We play in the main bar and also in 
the Stables area at the rear of the premises.

It’s not necessary to be a paid-up member of Streatham & Brixton Chess Club to participate – everyone is welcome 
and you won’t have to pay any subscriptions or fees. Beginners can join in, and juniors too if they are 
accompanied by an adult. Strong players often drop by for a few games of blitz chess and several of our 
Tuesday regulars also play for our league teams. There are rapidplay competitions and other opportunities to 
take part in.

Why not come along to one of our sessions – we’ll be delighted to see you.
