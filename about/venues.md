### Chess in Central London

{% include image.html url="/assets/photos/central-london.jpg" description="London League match at Golden Lane Community Centre" %}

You don’t have to live in the Streatham area to play for us – many of our members live north of the river or outside 
London. They prefer to play their team chess in Central London because of the convenient location and the high quality 
that the [London Chess League](http://www.londonchess.org.uk/main.php) offers. In fact we play more league chess at 
Golden Lane than we do at Woodfield Grove.

We have four teams in the London Chess League – a 12-board team in Division 1, a 10-board team in Division 2, 
an 8-board team in Division 4, and a 4-board team in the Major division. Most matches are played at the Golden 
Lane Community Centre, which is located [here](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Golden+Lane+Community+Association/@51.5225151,-0.0952356,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x48761b563a41dfa5:0xe51de4f4735ca703) on the Barbican estate.

If you think you might like to play for us in the London Chess League, please contact one of our club officers.

###Chess at Woodfield Grove

We get together at Woodfield Grove Tennis Club in Streatham on most Tuesday evenings during the chess season 
(which runs from September through to May). 

Here we play home matches in the [Surrey League](http://www.scca.co.uk/) and the 
[Croydon & District League](http://www.croydonchessleague.org.uk/). We have an 8-board team in 
the top division of the Surrey League, three 4-board teams in the Croydon & District League, and we play in 
one of the Surrey League knockout competitions. Our away matches are held at various venues in South London and Surrey. We also play internal club competitions at Woodfield Grove.

Woodfield Grove Tennis Club is located at 9 Woodfield Grove, London SW16 1LR. There's a map 
[here](https://goo.gl/maps/IH4ra), please note the club is on the south side of the road. 
The entrance is at the end of the terrace down a short path and access is via an entryphone. 
It is about 10 minutes walk from Streatham Hill mainline station and there are 
bus stops along Streatham High Road.

If you are arriving by car, it is best to park on Woodfield Avenue where there are plenty of spaces. 
Woodfield Grove itself is one-way and can only be approached by car from Woodfield Avenue.

You can play chess at [Streatham Library](http://www.lambeth.gov.uk/places/streatham-library) every Tuesday throughout the year. Streatham Library is [here](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/London+SW16+1PN/@51.4317243,-0.1291294,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x487604280906fd47:0xa10f28b2b86f41a0) at 63 Streatham High Road, SW16 1PN. We meet in the Mark Bennett Community Centre from 4.30 to 7.30 pm and players of all ages and abilities are welcome, including beginners. We ask that children under 10 are accompanied by an adult. There is nothing to pay and you don't have to be a member of Streatham & Brixton Chess Club to participate. 

Strong players often drop by for a few games of blitz chess and several of our Tuesday regulars also play for our league teams. There are rapidplay competitions and other opportunities to take part in.

After 7.30 pm on a Tuesday you will usually find us at the [White Lion bar](http://whitelion.org.uk/) where we often carry on playing till late. The White Lion is located [here](https://goo.gl/maps/rlRcp) at 232/234 Streatham High Road, SW16 1BB.
