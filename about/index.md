Streatham & Brixton Chess Club goes back a long way. Our club was founded around 125 years ago and we are still flourishing today with more than 60 active members.

We have several teams in the London Chess League which play their matches at venues in [Central London](/about/venues.html). 
In addition, we have teams in the Surrey Chess League and the Croydon & District Chess League, which play their home matches at 
[Woodfield Grove](/about/venues.html#woodfield-grove) in Streatham. Our venue for social chess is the [White Lion](/about/venues.html#whitelion) bar on Streatham High Road. 
Club competitions are held at our Woodfield Grove venue.

Although we don’t have a junior section, keen youngsters are welcome to join us at our White Lion Wednesday evening sessions. There are opportunities for strong juniors to play in our league teams.

A group of our members is responsible for the widely-read [Streatham & Brixton Chess Blog](http://streathambrixtonchess.blogspot.com/), a past winner of the English Chess Federation’s Website of the Year award. There you’ll find articles and discussion about chess in general and our club in particular. The [chess graffiti](http://streathambrixtonchess.blogspot.com/2009/06/chess-graffiti.html) picture on this page, and the other chess-in-art illustrations on this website, are all taken from the blog.
