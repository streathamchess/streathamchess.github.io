Streatham & Brixton Chess Club goes back a long way. Our club was founded over [150 years ago](/clubhistory/index.html) and we are still flourishing today with over 40 active [members](/members.html).

The club has a full [programme of events](/calendar/index.html), with up to
three matches a week during the league season, and social chess all
year round. We have teams in the London Chess League (which plays at
several venues in Central London), and the Central London Chess League (which plays at Pimlico). In addition, we have teams in the Croydon
and District League where we play our home matches at the Café at
St.Thomas Church, Telford Avenue off Streatham Hill. We also use this
venue for occasional club events -- but our venue for weekly social
chess is Streatham Library on Streatham High Road. See [Where we play](/about/venues.html) for full details
of these venues. We are also affiliated to the Surrey League, and
participate in the Online 4 Nations Chess League.

Although we don’t have a junior section, youngsters are welcome to join us at our Streatham Library Tuesday sessions. There are opportunities for strong juniors to play in our league teams.

A group of our members was responsible for the widely-read [Streatham & Brixton Chess Blog](http://streathambrixtonchess.blogspot.com/), a past winner of the English Chess Federation’s Website of the Year award. There you’ll find articles and discussion about chess in general and our club in particular. The [chess graffiti](http://streathambrixtonchess.blogspot.com/2009/06/chess-graffiti.html) picture on this page, and the other chess-in-art illustrations on this website, are all taken from the blog.
