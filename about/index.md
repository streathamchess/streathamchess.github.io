Streatham & Brixton Chess Club goes back a long way. Our club was founded over [150 years ago](/clubhistory/index.html) and we are still flourishing today with over 40 active [members](/members.html).

The club has a full [programme of events](/calendar/index.html), with two or three matches many weeks during the league season, and social chess all year round. We have several teams in the London Chess League which play their matches at various venues in [Central London](/about/venues.html). In addition, we have teams in the Surrey Chess League and the Croydon & District Chess League, which play their home matches at [Streatham Library](/about/venues.html#woodfield-grove), located on Streatham High Road. The library is also our main venue for [social chess](/about/venues.html#whitelion) and various club competitions.

Although we don’t have a junior section, youngsters are welcome to join us at our Streatham Library Tuesday sessions. There are opportunities for strong juniors to play in our league teams.

A group of our members was responsible for the widely-read [Streatham & Brixton Chess Blog](http://streathambrixtonchess.blogspot.com/), a past winner of the English Chess Federation’s Website of the Year award. There you’ll find articles and discussion about chess in general and our club in particular. The [chess graffiti](http://streathambrixtonchess.blogspot.com/2009/06/chess-graffiti.html) picture on this page, and the other chess-in-art illustrations on this website, are all taken from the blog.
