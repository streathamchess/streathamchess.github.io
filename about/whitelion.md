You can play chess at the White Lion bar on Wednesday evenings throughout the year from 5.00 to 8.00 pm. 
The White Lion is located [here](https://goo.gl/maps/rlRcp) at 232/234 Streatham High Road, SW16 1BB. We play in the main bar and also in 
the Stables area at the rear of the premises.

It’s not necessary to be a paid-up member of Streatham & Brixton Chess Club to participate – everyone is welcome 
and you won’t have to pay any subscriptions or fees. Beginners can join in, and juniors too if they are 
accompanied by an adult. Strong players often drop by for a few games of blitz chess and several of our 
Wednesday regulars also play for our league teams. There are rapidplay competitions and other opportunities to 
take part in.

Why not come along to one of our sessions – we’ll be delighted to see you.
