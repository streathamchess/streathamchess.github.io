We get together at Woodfield Grove Tennis Club in Streatham on most Tuesday evenings during the chess season 
(which runs from September through to May). 

Here we play home matches in the [Surrey League](http://www.scca.co.uk/) and the 
[Croydon & District League](http://www.croydonchessleague.org.uk/). We have an 8-board team in 
the top division of the Surrey League, four 4-board teams in the Croydon & District League, and we also play in 
Surrey League's knockout competitions. Our away matches are held at various venues in South London and Surrey.

We play internal club competitions at Woodfield Grove, and during the season we have occasional open evenings 
when chess players who are thinking of joining can meet us and play some informal games. If you are interested 
in coming along to our next open evening, please contact one of our club officers.

Woodfield Grove Tennis Club is located at 9 Woodfield Grove, London SW16 1LR. There's a map 
[here](https://goo.gl/maps/IH4ra), please note the club is on the south side of the road. 
The entrance is at the end of the terrace down a short path and access is via an entryphone. 
It is about 10 minutes walk from Streatham Hill mainline station and there are 
bus stops along Streatham High Road.

If you are arriving by car, it is best to park on Woodfield Avenue where there are plenty of spaces. 
Woodfield Grove itself is one-way and can only be approached by car from Woodfield Avenue.
