You don’t have to live in the Streatham area to play for us – many of our members live north of the river or outside 
London. They prefer to play their team chess in Central London because of the convenient location and the high quality 
that the [London Chess League](http://www.londonchess.org.uk/main.php) offers. In fact we play more league chess at 
Golden Lane than we do at Woodfield Grove.

We have four teams in the London Chess League – a 12-board team in Division 1, a 10-board teams in Division 2, 
an 10-board team in Division 3, and a 4-board team in the Minor division. Most matches are played at the Golden 
Lane Community Centre, which is located here on the Barbican estate.

If you think you might like to play for us in the London Chess League, please contact one of our club officers.
