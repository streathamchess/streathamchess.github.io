Bb3 b5 {This pawn sac took me by surprise...I decided I needed to react by playing aggressively } 12. Ndxb5 Qb8 13. Nd4 a5 14. a4 Rc8 15. h4 Nc4 16. Bxc4 Rxc4 17. b3 Rb4 18. h5 Qb7 19. hxg6 fxg6 20. Bh6 {With the intention of provoking Nxe4; but I was worried about 20...Bh8 instead. Simon found the right defence on moves 21 and 22. There were plenty of ways to go wrong. } 20... Nxe4 21. Qe3 Bxd4 22. Rxd4 Nxc3 23. Qxc3 e5 {When he played this I assumed I could not play 24. Rxd6 Rc8 25. Qxe5 as 25...Bf5 looks too strong. After the game it suddenly occurred to me I could have played 26. Rc6. Although I was short of time in the game, I should have looked a bit deeper. I think the fact that the bishop was on d7 a move earlier made me think Rc6 wasn't possible. } 24. Rxb4 axb4 25. Qc4+ d5 26. Qc5 Bf5 27. Rd1 Rc8 28. Qxd5+ Qxd5 29. Rxd5 Rxc2+ 30. Kd1 Rxg2 31. Rxe5 Kf7 32. Bd2 h5 {In this endgame I thought his h pawn would be quicker than my a pawn, so I aimed for R v R&B...though I assume Simon had a win at some point. } 33. a5 Bd3 34. Re3 Bf1 35. Re1 Rf2 36. Bxb4 h4 37. Re7+ Kf6 38. Be1 Rxf3 39. Bxh4+ g5 40. Bxg5+ Kxg5 41. Rb7 Bd3 42. Kd2 Be4 43. Rb8 Kf4 44. a6 Rd3+ 45. Ke2 Rd7 46. Rf8+ Ke5 47. Re8+ Kd4 48. Re6 Rh7 49.
