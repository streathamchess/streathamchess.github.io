1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. g3 d5 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. Bg2 Nc7 7. O-O e5 {
Fabiano was pleased with the opening, saying he was playing white in a Maroczy
with a tempo down.} 8. a3 Rb8 9. d3 Be7 10. Be3 O-O 11. Rc1 Bd7 12. Nd2 {White
has given up on b4 ideas, and switches to f4 ideas instead!} Nd4 13. Nc4 f6 14.
f4 exf4 15. Bxf4 Nde6 16. Bd2 b6 {The whole game has been slow positional
maneuvering, where neither side can really claim any edge. The next move
shocked Alejandro and me!} 17. g4 $5 {Diagram #} Be8 18. Be1 {Ah, the point of
17.g4!? Topalov wants to play Bg3 and control dark squares. Fabiano nicely
thwarts his opponent's plans.} b5 $1 {In the commentary afterwards, Fabiano
said he was worried a bit about the c5 pawn, but thought it would be okay.} 19.
Ne3 Bd6 {Diagram # Black drives away the Nc4 so he can play Bd6-e5. An idea
which works excellently!} 20. Ncd5 $2 {The next few moves shows that Veselin
has lost the thread of the game. By trading pieces and giving black Be5, his
g4 move is simply weakening. Now black seizes the initiative!} Nxd5 21. Bxd5
Bf7 22. Nf5 Be5 23. Qd2 $2 {Fabiano thought this was the losing move. Now
black gets to hop his knight to a great square, and with tempo!} Nd4 $1 24.
Bxf7+ Rxf7 {With Nb3 in the air, and 25.Nxd4 unplayable, due to 25...Qxd4+
forking, white is in big trouble.} 25. Rd1 Nxf5 26. gxf5 Qd4+ 27. Bf2 Qg4+ 28.
Kh1 c4 $1 29. Qc2 Re8 $1 {Diagram # Fabiano finishes with computer-like
precision. White is defenseless on both sides of the board, and the center!}
30. dxc4 $2 Qh5 31. h4 ({The natural} 31. Bg1 {loses to} Bxh2 32. Bxh2 Rxe2 {
and here Fabiano pointed out that if he had played his other rook to the "e"
file with 29...Re7, then white would play 33.Qxe2 and 33.Bxb8 here!}) 31... Qg4
32. Qd3 bxc4 33. Qe3 Rfe7 34. b3 Bb2 0-1

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {The Scotch! I would normally say that MVL gets the
first surprise, but I don't either player was surprised this game!} exd4 4.
Nxd4 Bc5 5. Nb3 Bb6 6. Nc3 Nf6 7. Qe2 {Magnus played this way (7.Qe2) against
Bacrot a few years ago and won. Black usually plays 7...0-0 here, but Magnus
plays an extremely rare move.} a5 {Diagram # This was played in the Ukranian
Championship by Elijanov. White played 8.a4, preventing black from doing the
same. MVL immediately plays the most testing move.} 8. e5 O-O $1 9. exf6 a4 10.
Nd5 Re8 11. Be3 axb3 12. Qg4 g6 13. Bc4 {Diagram # Somehow, this must have
been pre-game prep for both players, as they rushed to this position! I don't
understand how MVL could have anazlyed 7...a5 so deeply, since this move is
played less than 1% of the time! Instead, Magnus seemed surprised by the
Stockfish recommended 13.Bc4, and went into the tank.} Nb4 $1 {Played after 30
minutes of thought. This move, and 13...Bd4 are the engine recommended moves.
Alejandro, at first, thought there was no way Magnus would play this (I heard
this before last year, and Magnus usually played the "computer move" in these
situations).} 14. Nxb4 {And MVL also thought about 25 minutes on his response!
Even though he clearly prepared this variation, he either did not know, or
forgot this move. Now both player were clearly on their own.} d5 {The point of
Nb4... now the powerful white Nd5 is missing, and white has many pieces pinned
and attacked.} 15. Qf4 dxc4 16. O-O bxc2 $1 {Black has a lot of tempting
choices, but, as usual, Magnus finds the best move. This prevents white from
playing either rook to d1.} 17. Nd5 ({Perhaps a little bit better was} 17. Bxb6

Qc5 Bb7 21. Ne7+ {MVL and Magnus are both playing fantastic moves. Now the
game could end in a draw, but Magnus plays for the win!} Kh8 (21... Rxe7 22.

Rac1 $6 {Probably MVL saw the final position when he played this move. But 23.
Rad1 should be equal.} Rxf6 24. Rxf6 Rxf6 25. Qxc7 {Diagram #} Qd2 $6 {Magnus
played this with only a few minutes remaining. Instead, black has the edge in
the pawn down ending (!) after 25...Qd3!} ({Better was} 25... Qd3 26. Qc3 Qxc3
