1. c4 b6 2. e4 c5 {unusual but black can try many things against the English
and often get away with it} 3. g3 Bb7 4. Bg2 Nc6 5. Ne2 Nd4 6. O-O g6 7.
Nbc3
Bg7 8. d3 h5 {aggressive and an increasingly common move in the English.
However the aggression ended here as the pawn never moved again} 9. Nxd4
Bxd4
10. Ne2 Bg7 11. d4 {in some senses I had lost a tempo by playing d2-d3-d4.
However things are not normally that clear- things have changed in the
meantime and the game may have taken a different course, preventing d2-d4.
Here for instance h7-h5 has been played since I played d2-d3} cxd4 12.
Nxd4 Rc8
13. b3 {the diagonal looks strong for black, but he hasn't got the firepower
to exploit it, so in the meantime I will remove the rook away to create an
empty diagonal} Nf6 {for several moves I had been hopeful of spring a common
trap in the Hedgehog e4-e5, Bxg2, exf6 with both the g2 and g7 bishops still
being attacked. Here the f6 knight blocks the trap with e4-e5, Ne4. It may
still be a good continuation however for white} (13... h4 {this may have
been more promising, certainly in a rapidplay game. I was planning on not
getting too concerned however, trusting in my development lead}) 14. Re1
(14. e5
Ne4
15. Re1 Nc5 {material loss has been averted but white has a pleasant
position})
14... Qc7 {defending the bishop on b7 is a way of preventing the trap after
e4-e5 as the knight can just move away} (14... Ng4 {stopping the e4-e5
tricks by moving the knight may have been best. White still looks better
however and
h7-h5 is starting to look weakening}) 15. Bf4 {however the queen is now in
trouble} Qc5 (15... d6 16. e5 dxe5 17. Bxe5 Qd7 {I hadn't worked out what to
do here but figured black's position is very shaky- as the computer
confirms} 18. Nb5 Qxd1 19. Raxd1 Bxg2 20. Bxf6 Bxf6 21. Nd6+) 16. e5 {looks
like the trap will now work} Bxg2 17. b4 {this zwischenzug is important as
it diverts the queen away from attacking the d4 knight} (17. exf6 {the trap
does not deliver the promised material gains- black has the last laugh as
the d4 knight will be undefended} Bxf6 18. Kxg2 Bxd4 {black restores piece
equality with an extra pawn to boot}) 17... Qxb4 (17... Qxc4 {staying on the
knight but running into a bigger problem} 18. Rc1) 18. exf6 Bxf6 19. Kxg2
Rxc4 {so I have won my piece but black has picked up three pawns and I have
a problem with the d4 knight now} 20. Rc1 {there are other options like Nf3
and Rb1, but this is the most flashy- the knight is defended without it
being moved by making use of a potential back rank mate} Rxc1 (20... Bxd4
21. Qxd4 Rxd4 22. Rc8#) (20... Rxd4 21. Rc8#) 21. Qxc1 O-O 22. Nf3 {will not
be easy with a piece for three pawns but I have stopped the black rook
becoming active and there are possible mating ideas involving Qh6} Qa5 23.
Be5 Qxa2 (23... Bxe5 24. Rxe5 Qxa2 25. Qh6 {with Ng5 and mate or large
material gain}) 24. Bxf6 exf6 25. Qc3 {the mate threats are gone but black
is now passive and his pawns are quite weak now} Kg7 26. Ra1 Qd5 27. Rxa7
Re8 (27... Ra8 {would have been more tenancious as black gets to develop his
rook. Black was down to under a minute (plus 5 sec increments now however).
White had maybe 5 minutes left}) 28. Qd4 Qxd4 { otherwise more material loss
would occur and f7 would get attacked} 29.
Nxd4 d5
30. Rd7 Re5 31. f4 Re8 32. Rxd5 f5 33. Rd6 {Black lost on time here despite
5 second increments (I had about 5 mins left). The final position would
still require some work, but black's kingside pawns are pretty static and it
should be just a matter of time. Indeed black with good grace here said he
felt the position was resignable anyway} 1-0
