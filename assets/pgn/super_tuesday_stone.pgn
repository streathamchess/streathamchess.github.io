Nxe6 fxe6 19. exd4 cxd4 20. Qe2 Kf7 21. Rd3 Qc5 {he said he miscalculated the following sequence, but I was better anyway} 22. Re1 e5 23. Qxe5 Qxe5 24. Rxe5 Rc2 25. Re2 Rdc8 26. Rxc2 Rxc2 27. Bxd4 {perhaps he missed that Rd1 was now possible as the e2 rook has been exchanged off} Rxa2 28. g3 a5 29. Bc6 h6 30. Kg2 {a cowardly draw offer a pawn up. Still, despite the high evaluation winning this is not straight forward. Bb5-c4 could run into Rc2 a5-a4. I didn't manage to beat Stockfish in a casual game taking a few moves back albeit granted it is stronger than even my GM opponent. Although hardly classed as time trouble, 10 mins for 6 moves does not give time for great accuracy} 1/2-1/2
