Rfe1 Ng4 {At the time I thought this was risky - though it secures the bishop pair - and it certainly looks anti-positional pawn-wise; but it looks OK on further analysis. Stockfish thinks Black can play 22...fxe4 too, as the activity of Black's white squared bishop makes up for the activity of White's knights. However, it would have made White's position easier to play from a practical perspective. } 23. Bxg4 fxg4 24. g3 Qe7 25. Nfd1 b5 26. Bf2 h3 27. Nb2 Rb8 28. Re2 Rec8 29. Rce1 {White is in a lot of trouble after this, but the knight manoeuvre to b2 in moves 25 to 27 must contribute to his difficulties.} 29... c4 30. bxc4 bxc4 31. e5 Bf5 32. Bd4 Nc2 33. Nbd1 Bd3 34.
