1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. e4 d6 4. f3 Bg7 5. Be3 O-O 6. Qd2 c6 {I have had a
similar position to this lots of times and usually play a4 here to stop ...b5,
but I forgot} 7. Be2 b5 8. a4 b4 9. Nd1 a5 10. Nf2 Ba6 {as he has already
castled, maybe it is ok that my knight has been driven to the kingside} 11. Bh6
Qb6 12. Bxg7 Kxg7 13. h4 h5 14. g4 Nbd7 15. Bxa6 Qxa6 16. Ne2 e5 17. Ng3 Rh8
18. Qg5 Kf8 {after this passive move, I realised I was better and had a good
chance to win} 19. dxe5 dxe5 20. O-O-O c5 21. gxh5 Rxh5 {he said that he had
to play this and give up the exchange} 22. Nxh5 gxh5 23. Rd2 {I could see his
pawn being played to c3 and was not sure what was going to happen} c4 24. Rhd1
Qc6 $2 {now, White to play and win} 25. Qh6+ {if kg8 obviously rg1+ and if ke7
or ke8 26 rxd7 wins, as the queen is loose  (you cant beat a loose queen)} 1-0
