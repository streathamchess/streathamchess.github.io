title:  More S&BCC History Discovered
---

In January 2016 the Povah-Best Trophy returned to the club – you can read about it [here](/2016/03/14/trophy-returns.html). Just a few months later, in March 2016, another bit of our history was also restored: copies of a club newsletter from 1966 to 1967. We are grateful to Martin Cath for their safe-keeping. It seems that, in the mists of time, a S&BCC secretary passed them to him, along with copies of an even more ancient publication “The London Chess Bulletin” on 1949 (of which more in the Appendix <a href="#appendix">below</a>).

You can see and/or download the S&BCC Newsletter 1966/7 [here](/assets/newsletter)...
