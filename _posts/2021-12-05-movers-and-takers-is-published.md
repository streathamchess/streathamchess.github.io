You've waited 150 years for it: the story of Streatham and Brixton chess! Produced and published with the generous assistance of the Streatham Society, *Movers and Takers* charts the trajectory of our two ancestors (Brixton and Streatham Chess Clubs) up to their amalgamation in 1946, and then on to the present day.

Fully illustrated over 116 pages, in 20 chapters, *Movers and Takers* also tells of the players - whether members or not - who animated the local (and sometimes the national) chess scene.
