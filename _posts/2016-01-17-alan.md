title: Alan Romeril wins vs. DHSS player

My opponent resigned before his 33rd move with about 3 minutes left before time control
in a position that would have been tricky to do anything with.  He had weakened his
king with f6, g6 and f5 whereas my king was quite a lot safer so I exchanged most
pieces and kept the queens on and planned to harass his king and mop some pawns
up whilst my king was tucked away from checks.
