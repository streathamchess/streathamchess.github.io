What a season! Our club’s highly successful 2013/14 campaign is drawing to a close – these are the highlights...

After just one season in Division 2, our London League first team has secured promotion and will be back in Division 1 next season.
We had two teams in Division 2, our second team having been promoted from Division 3 last year - it too had a very satisfactory season and
should finish in a mid-table position.

Our third London League team is on the brink of promotion from Division 4, with two matches left to play, while our fourth team
has concluded a successful inaugural season in the Minor Division with 5.5 points from a possible 9.

In the Surrey League’s knockout Lauder Trophy competition, our team is in the final against Crystal Palace, to be played next week.

We have four teams in the Croydon League, two of which have won their divisions – our C team finished top of Division 3 and we also
won the Rapidplay Division.
