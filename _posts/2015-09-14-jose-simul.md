To those of you who are interested in my game of yesterday against GM Peter Wells. I suppose one may be forgiven to believe that grandmasters possess a certain kind of aura and hypnotism that somehow paralyses their opponents.  I was becoming more and more nervous as the game progressed and its pace heightened! I am sure in the hands of a skilled craftsman, Black should have brought home the full point being 3+ according the engine!
