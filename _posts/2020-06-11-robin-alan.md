**Ham, egg and chips.**

No, not a variation of the 'Fried Liver Attack' but what was at steak
(sorry: stake) in a game-by-text played by club stalwarts Alan Hayward
and Robin Haldane to while away Lockdown. The rule was one move a day,
and no computers. They played two games. One was drawn, but other was a
dogfight (below, and attached in an active game-player) in which they
went at each other hammer and tongs. When the smoke had cleared Robin
emerged the winner, and claimed his free lunch (if ever there was such a
thing). Unusually, and most interestingly, the two players give their
own notes on the game. Sit back and enjoy.

**White   Robin Haldane. Black   Alan Hayward**

**(with comments by both players -- *Robin's in italics*). **

**1 e4 d5 2 exd5 nf6  3 nc3 nxd5** (I always play the Scandinavian -
Alan)

**4 Bc4 nb6 5 Bb3 nc6 6 nf3 Bf5 7 d4 e6 8 a3 Be7 9 Be3 0-0 10 qe2 Bf6 11
0-0-0 nd5** (I liked this move as it stopped some of White\'s options -
Alan) 

**12 nxd5 exd5 13 rhg1** (*I didn\'t fancy 13 qb5 Be6 14 qxb7 na5 Black
gets a very strong, probably winning attack - Robin*)

**13 \... rb8 14 g4 Be6 15 g5 Be7 16 nh4 re8 17 f4 qd7 18 qf3 f5 **

**19 Bf2** (*I was tempted to play 19 gxf6 Bxf6 20 f5 Bf7  21 ng6 hxg6
22 fxg6 Be6 23 rdf1 but there were too many complications - Robin*)

**19 \...na5 20 Ba2 b5 21 g6 h6** (I thought my king looked very secure
now - Alan)

**22 rge1 nc4 23 Bxc4 bxc4 24 re2 Bf6** (I did not play 24 \...
Bxh4  because I was concerned about 25 Bxh4 followed  by 26 Bg5  and 27
Bxh6 - Alan), (*instead of 24 \... Bf6  I was expecting 24 \... Bxh4 25
Bxh4 qb5 26 qc3 when I thought there were equal chances - Robin*) 

**25 rde1 c5 26 nxf5** (*after this, I thought I had the edge, but knew
it would be a close thing. If now 26 \... Bxf5 27 qxd5+ kf8 28 qxc5+ Be7
29 rxe7 rxe7 30 rxe7 qxe7 31 qxf5+ White would be better - Robin)*

**26 \...kf8 27 ng3 cxd4 28 f5 qb5**  (*if 28 \... Bg5+, I was intending
to play 29 Be3 and if instead 28 \... Bg8 I would play 29 rxe8+ rxe8 30
rxe8+ qxe8 31 qe2 - Robin*) 

**29 Bxd4 Bxd4 30 fxe6+ Bf6 31 c3 d4 32 nf5**

(the most complicated position of the game I thought and I looked at this
position for 2 hours 1am to 3am and rejected, after about four looks, 32
\... d3, 32...dxc3 and 32...rxe6. I played \... rb6 and Robin said he
was quite relieved that I played this, which is quite funny to come up
with the wrong answer after looking for 2 hours while half asleep -
Alan)  (*if 32 \...  rxe6 33 rxe6 qxb2+ 34 kd1 d3 35 rxf6+.  If 32  \...
dxc3  33 e7+ kg8 34 nxh6+. If 32 \...d3, I was intending to play 33 rf2
- Robin*)

**32 \... rb6  33 nxd4 qg5+ 34 kb1 qxg6+ 35 qe4 qxe4+ 36 rxe4 g6** (*if
36 \... Bxd4 I was intending 37 cxd4 reb8 38 r1e2 c3 39 b4 a5 40 d5 -
Robin*)     

**37 ka2 a6 38 nf3 g5 39 nd2** (now White wins the c pawn and I am lost
- Alan)
