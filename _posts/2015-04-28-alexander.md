Streatham managed just one point out of ten in Monday's Alexander Cup semifinal match against strong Redhill team, in what was even worse performance than Nigel Short's [recent match](https://chess24.com/en/read/news/kasparov-short-the-st-louis-massacre) against Garry Kasparov.

Two positive results came from Robin and David.

Robin managed to draw in what looked like very complicated game, despite arriving late and having to play with 33 minutes vs. 60 minutes time handicap. 

Another half point was due to David's play in strange French Winawer which went 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. a3 Bxc3+ 5. bxc3 dxe4 6. Qd2 ?!
