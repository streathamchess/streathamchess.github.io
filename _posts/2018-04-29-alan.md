Our 3rd team played a match against BBCA 1 this week. It was not an easy match with our team being outgraded on every board with average difference of 30 ECF points. We escaped with 2-6 loss, however our captain scored nice win against strong opponent with nice tactical shot and calm conversion in Kings Indian.
