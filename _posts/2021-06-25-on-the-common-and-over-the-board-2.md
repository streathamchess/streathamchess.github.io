That’s Robin Haldane and Richard Tillett (under the hat), Angus French (another hat) playing Mark Orpen in the foreground, and Kostya Titorenko and son Peter in combat with Antony Hall further back. Matt Carter, Alex Spencer (behind the camera) and son Marcus were also there, as was Olga (Peter’s mum). Jagdip Patel and Garry Smith arrived later.
