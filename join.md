Anyone can join our Wednesday afternoon [White Lion chess group](/about/whitelion.html) and there’s nothing 
to pay. If it’s full-on, league chess that you want, you can choose one of two membership 
options to suit you – annual subscription or game fee. 
As an annual subscription member you pay just half of the full subscription in your first season. 
If you only want to play a few games for us the best option for you may be to pay on a game-by-game basis. 
To play league chess you will also need to be a member of the English Chess Federation (ECF): 
Bronze membership costs £12 for a year if you sign up online - see 
[here](http://www.englishchess.org.uk/?page_id=20558) for further information.

Subscription rates for the 2014-2015 season are:

* £30 full membership.
* £15 first year of membership.
* £15 concessionary rate (available on a discretionary basis to student, unwaged and retired members).
* If you prefer to pay on a game-by-game basis, the cost is £3.00 per game for ECF members.
 
As a member you will be qualified to play for our league teams, subject to selection, and you will be able to participate in club competitions and other members-only events.

If you’re thinking of joining or would like to know more about membership, please contact one of our club officers.
